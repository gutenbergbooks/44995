Desbarrolles, D'Arpentigny and De Para d'Hermes. The various lines and
mounts on the palm of the hand, and the typical formation of the hand
and fingers are all clearly explained and illustrated by diagrams. The
meaning to be deduced from the greater or less development of these
mounts and lines (each of which has its own signification), also from
the length, thickness and shape of the thumb and fingers, and from the
mutual bearing they exercise on each other, is all distinctly
explained. Complete facility for instant reference is insured by means
